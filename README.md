# Career Conversation Agent Chatbot

A conversational AI chatbot that represents a professional (e.g., Abdul Qudoos) for career-related Q&A, built with Python, Gradio, Gemini (Google LLM), and Pushover notifications.

## Features
- Answers questions about the professional's background, skills, and experience using Gemini LLM.
- Reads summary and LinkedIn profile from PDF and text files.
- Sends push notifications via Pushover when a user provides their email or asks an unknown question.
- Simple web chat interface powered by Gradio.

## Agentic AI Capabilities
This chatbot is designed with agentic AI principles, enabling it to:
- **Autonomously use tools:** The agent can trigger internal functions (tools) such as recording user details or logging unknown questions, without user intervention.
- **Context-aware actions:** The agent maintains context from the user's conversation, using it to decide when to prompt for contact information or escalate unanswered questions.
- **Proactive engagement:** If the agent cannot answer a question, it records the event and can encourage the user to provide more information or get in touch.
- **Seamless integration:** Tool use and notifications are handled in the background, so the user experience remains natural and uninterrupted.
- **Extendable agent framework:** The architecture allows for easy addition of new tools or actions, making the agent adaptable to new requirements or workflows.

## Notifications
