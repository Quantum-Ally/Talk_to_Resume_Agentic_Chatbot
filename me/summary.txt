I'm Abdul Qudoos, a final-year Software Engineering student at FAST University with a CGPA of 3.5 and a highest SGPA of 3.9. I was born in Azad Kashmir and moved to Islamabad for my graduation. My core interests lie in AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and full-stack web development using technologies like MERN stack, Next.js, Firebase, SQL, and NoSQL. I also work with DevOps tools, have experience with Kubernetes, and I'm currently diving into Agentic AI.

I'm skilled in Python, PHP, and always eager to build smart, scalable solutions. Outside of tech, I enjoy cricket, chess and other online shooting games. Iâ€™m dedicated, always learning, and passionate about using technology to make an impact.
